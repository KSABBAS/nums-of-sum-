in this app i intend to explain you (user) enter a number (a random number) and enter the number of tries 
and then the programme speculates the number that can be added together to equal the valie of the number you entered randomly 
an example 
20 can be formed from on of thoes 
5+5+5+5
or 10+10
or 7+4+5+4
and the number of tries is the number that the programme will try to find number that can be added together to equal the randomly selected number.
